# Aerotemp - uottahack 7

### Objective:
A basic prototype which uses a temperature sensor to monitor the environmental temperature around an aircraft, alerting the pilot if the temperature deviates from a safe range, and displays this information in a visual format (LCD screen, serial monitor, or graphical representation).

### Key Features:
* Temperature Montoring
* Visual Representation
* Audible/Visual Alerts

### Components:
* Arduino
* Temperature Sensor
* Display Screen
* Buzzer/LEDs
* Resistors
* Jumper wires and breadboard
